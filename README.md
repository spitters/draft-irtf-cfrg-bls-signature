# BLS Standard Draft

The repo is maintained by a working group aiming to standardize BLS signature scheme.
This repo was moved from [here](https://github.com/pairingwg/bls_standard).

## News:

* Updated from -02 to -03 and from -03 to -04.
  * -03 is a compatibility release for existing implementations.
  * -04 is an update that addresses a potential security concern.

* Updated from -00 to -02. See changelog.

* This draft has been adopted by the CFRG as an active [work group draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-02)

## Changelog:
* Changes from draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-03 to draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signtuare-04:
  * KeyGen and KeyValidate updated. KeyValidate now rejects PK if it represents the
    identity element. KeyGen likewise will not generate SK = 0, which would result
    in an identity public key.
  * Security Considerations updated with a discussion of why identity PK is disallowed.

* Changes from draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-02 to draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signtuare-03:
  * Updated author affiliations
  * Updated hash-to-curve reference to version -09
  * minor pagination changes

* Changes from draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-01 to draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-02:
  * No change, maintenance release only: fix broken bibliography entry for hash-to-curve.

* Changes from draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-00 to draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-01:
  * Improve APIs:
    * make API functions take array/tuple of keys/messages instead of being variadic
    * clarify that functions taking multiple inputs are only valid when n >= 1
  * Remove SK-to-PK functionality from KeyGen; moved it to SkToPk function.
  * Tweaks to KeyGen:
    * append a null byte to IKM (lets us prove indifferentiability)
    * add optional key_info parameter (lets one generate different keys from same IKM)
    * append I2OSP(L, 2) to the info argument to HKDF-Expand. Ensures that changing L gives orthogonal output.
  * Update ciphersuites to use new hash-to-curve suite naming convention

* Changes from draft-boneh-bls-signature to draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-00:
  * Changed serialization methods
  * Use HKDF to derive keys
  * Use hash to curve/group methods from [Hash to curve draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-04)
